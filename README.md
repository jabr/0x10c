# 0x10c

This repository (will) contain my ideas, code, and utilities for working on [notch's DCPU-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0x10c).

At the moment, the highlights are syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 2, TextMate, etc under support; and my first pass at a cooperative threading library under threads.

Pull requests are welcome!
